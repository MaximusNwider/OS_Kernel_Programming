   - **`boot/`**  
     - Contains the bootloader code, **boot signature: 0x420**
     - Could be include different bootloader. 
   - **`arch/x86/`**  
     - Architecture-specific routines (GDT, IDT setup, interrupt assembly stubs).  
     - Low-level concurrency (spinlock implementations, atomic ops).  
     - Paging structures (page directories, page tables).
   - **`kernel/`**  
     - **Init**: Main kernel entry function, calls to set up memory, interrupts, etc.  
     - **Scheduler**: Contains scheduling policies, run queues, context switch code.  
     - **Process Management**: PCB/TCB creation, forking, etc.  
     - **IPC**: Message queues, pipes, shared memory.  
     - **Synchronization**: Spinlock, mutex, semaphore code.  
   - **`mem/`**  
     - Physical page allocator.  
     - Kernel heap allocator.  
     - Paging logic.  
   - **`drivers/`**  
     - Subdirectories for **PCI**, **storage**, **network**, **input**, **video**.  
     - Device initialization routines, interrupt handlers, and hardware-specific drivers.  
   - **`fs/`**  
     - VFS interface, filesystem drivers (FAT, NTFS, etc.).  
     - Buffer cache code, directory/file operations.  
   - **`lib/`**  
     - Generic data structures (linked lists, queues, heaps), as well as sorting/searching algorithms.  
     - Potential library of common functions typically present in math library.
   - **`include/`**  
     - Header files for each subsystem.
